# Golang
Quickly and easily install the Go programming language with a customisable workspace and version.

## Usage
In order to use this module do the following:

    class { 'golang': }

This will install go 1.3 and setup your workspace in `$HOME/.go`. Your chosen workspace should include a `bin`, `pkg` and `src` directory. The golang module doesn't create these to avoid using the wrong permissions which can cause potential issues using commands like `go get`.

## Additional Options
The golang module supports some additional options:

    class { 'golang':
      download_dir => '/usr/local/src',
      download_url => 'https://company.intranet/downloads/golang.tar.gz',
    }

#### download_dir
`download_dir` is the location in which the golang tarball is downloaded to. This is configurable in case the default (`/usr/local/src`) is unavailable.

#### download_url
This represents the url in which to download the golang tarball. The default url is made up of `version` and `arch` from the official golang downloads.

## Contributions
This module is fairly young and has only been tested on Debian. All contributions are welcome by forking the project and creating a pull request with your changes.

## Roadmap
There are still additional features which would make this module better:

1. Tests (tut, tut me for not doing them)
2. The ability to remove go
3. A Go project resource which would automatically symlink the directory?
